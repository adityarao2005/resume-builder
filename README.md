IT WORKS
TODO: Left over stuff to do:

1. refactor "Description" class such that there is no class and its just an array
2. Fix the mediaProfiles weird thing (i'd say jsut change the data structure from a Map to a List and implement methods to work on stuff)
3. Demo and show this to a prof and see what they think about what i've done so far - also fix up the way the layout is... its kinda cramped -- also demo to like Anshul, Deekshu, Kam, and others and get their input\
   3.1. I dont know whether it is better to check with them first or finish the ML grader then check with them afterwards
4. Think about moving from react-pdf (cuz its kinda been buggy and wont work with custom styles) to LaTeX or HTML2PDF or a custom node service
5. Decide whether to plan and implement custom styling first or the ML grader and resume generator or the profile page first
   5.1. Order of preference: ML grader (so i actually have a python service going), profile page setter + resume generator with AI, custom styling
